## Hi, I'm Maxim 👋
### Python programmer, Data Scientist

I love to do things with Python!  
After trying to use machine learning for my research tasks, I got too involved.  
I took a professional retraining course "Data Scientist" at Yandex.Practicum, and now I am developing in DS.  
Check out my Computer Vision and other projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently performing Сomputer Vision and Machine Learning tasks at Sberbank's Internal Audit Service
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning, Computer Vision
