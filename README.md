## Hi, I'm Maxim ðŸ‘‹
### Computer Vision Engeneer, Data Scientist

I love to do things with Python!  
After trying to use machine learning for my research tasks, I got too involved.  
I have had experience in applying computer vision skills in a bank's audit department, and now I am still developing in DS.  
Check out my Computer Vision and other projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently performing Ð¡omputer Vision and Data Science tasks at Skoltech's Applied AI Center
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning, Computer Vision
